Welcome to the official implementation of <strong>UnlearnDiffAtk</strong>, which capitalizes on the intrinsic classification abilities of Diffusion Models (DMs) to <strong>simplify the creation of adversarial prompts</strong>, thereby eliminating the need for auxiliary classification or diffusion models.Through extensive benchmarking, we <strong>evaluate the robustness</strong> of five widely-used safety-driven unlearned DMs (i.e., DMs after unlearning undesirable concepts, styles, or objects) across a variety of tasks.

## Abstract 
The recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized the generation of complex and
diverse images. However, these models also introduce potential safety hazards, such as the produc-
tion of harmful content and infringement of data copyrights. Although there have been efforts to
create safety-driven unlearning methods to counteract these challenges, doubts remain about their
capabilities. To bridge this uncertainty, we propose an evaluation framework built upon adversarial
attacks (also referred to as adversarial prompts), in order to discern the trustworthiness of these
safety-driven unlearned DMs. Specifically, our research explores the <strong>(worst-case) robustness of unlearned DMs</strong> in eradicating unwanted concepts, styles, and objects, assessed by the generation of
adversarial prompts. <strong>We develop a novel adversarial learning approach called UnlearnDiff that
leverages the inherent classification capabilities of DMs to streamline the generation of adversarial
prompts, making it as simple for DMs as it is for image classification attacks.</strong> This technique streamlines the creation of adversarial prompts, making the process as intuitive for generative modeling as it
is for image classification assaults. Through comprehensive benchmarking, we assess the unlearning
robustness of five prevalent unlearned DMs across multiple tasks. Our results underscore the effectiveness and efficiency of UnlearnDiff when compared to state-of-the-art adversarial prompting
methods

## [UnlearnDiffAtk: Unlearned Diffusion Model Benchmark](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Intel/UnlearnDiffAtk-Benchmark)

#### DM Unlearning Tasks:
* <strong>NSFW</strong>: Nudity
* <strong>Style</strong>: Van Gogh
* <strong>Object</strong>: Church, Tench, Parachute, Garbage Truck

 #### Evaluation Metrics:
 * Pre-Attack Success Rate (<strong>Pre-ASR</strong>): lower is better;
 * Post-Attack Success Rate (<strong>Post-ASR</strong>): lower is better;
 * Fr√©chet inception distance(<strong>FID</strong>): evaluate distributional quality of image generations, lower is better;
 * <strong>CLIP Score</strong>: measure contextual alignment with prompt descriptions, higher is better.
